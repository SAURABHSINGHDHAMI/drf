# Validation in Serializers

When dealing with data from the frontend, it's crucial to implement validation to ensure data integrity and security.

## serializers.py

```python
from rest_framework import serializers
from .models import Person

class PersonSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):

    class Meta:
        model = Person
        fields = '__all__'

    def validate(self, data):
        special_characters = "@#$%^&*()+=-[]{};:'\"\\|,<.>/?"
        
        # Check if name contains special characters
        if any(c in special_characters for c in data['name']):
            raise serializers.ValidationError('Name cannot contain special characters')

        # Check if age is greater than or equal to 18
        if data['age'] < 18:
            raise serializers.ValidationError('Age should be greater than or equal to 18')

        return data
```

Defined custom validation logic inside the `validate()` method.

This ensures that the data passed from the frontend meets certain criteria before being processed further.

Make sure to replace `'__all__'` with the actual list of fields if you want to restrict validation to specific fields.
